# Tribonacci Sequence

The Tribonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the three preceding ones. When starting with `0`, `0` and `1`, the first 10 numbers in the sequence are `0`, `0`, `1`, `1`, `2`, `4`, `7`, `13`, `24`, `44`.

Given an array containing the first three numbers of a Tribonacci sequence, and an integer representing the length of the sequence, return an array containing the sequence of the given length.

-   Your function should handle sequences of any length greater than or equal to zero.
-   If the length is zero, return an empty array.
-   Note that the starting numbers are part of the sequence.
