# Fill The Tank

Given the size of a fuel tank, the current fuel level, and the price per gallon, return the cost to fill the tank all the way.

-   `tankSize` is the total capacity of the tank in gallons.
-   `fuelLevel` is the current amount of fuel in the tank in gallons.
-   `pricePerGallon` is the cost of one gallon of fuel.
-   The returned value should be rounded to two decimal places in the format: `"$d.dd"`.
