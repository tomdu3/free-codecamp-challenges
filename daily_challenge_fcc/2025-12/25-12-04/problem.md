# Permutation Count

Given a string, return the number of distinct permutations that can be formed from its characters.

- A permutation is any reordering of the characters in the string.
- Do not count duplicate permutations.
- If the string contains repeated characters, repeated arrangements should only be counted once.
- The string will contain only letters (`A-Z`, `a-z`).

For example, given `"abb"`, return `3` because there's three unique ways to arrange the letters: `"abb"`, `"bab"`, and `"bba"`.
