## Inventory Update

Given a 2D array representing the inventory of your store, and another 2D array representing a shipment you have received, return your updated inventory.

-   Each element in the arrays will have the format: `[quantity, "item"]`, where `quantity` is an integer and `"item"` is a string.
-   Update items in the inventory by adding the quantity of any matching items from the shipment.
-   If a received item does not exist in the current inventory, add it as a new entry to the end of the inventory.
-   Return inventory in the order it was given with new items at the end in the order they appear in the shipment.

For example, given an inventory of `[[2, "apples"], [5, "bananas"]]` and a shipment of `[[1, "apples"], [3, "bananas"]]`, return `[[3, "apples"], [8, "bananas"]]`.
