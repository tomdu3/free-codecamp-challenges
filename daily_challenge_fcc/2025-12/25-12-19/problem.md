# Pairwise

Given an array of integers and a target number, find all pairs of elements in the array whose values add up to the target and return the sum of their indices.

For example, given `[2, 3, 4, 6, 8]` and `10`, you will find two valid pairs:

- `2` and `8` (2 + 8 = 10), whose indices are `0` and `4`
- `4` and `6` (4 + 6 = 10), whose indices are `2` and `3`

Add all the indices together to get a return value of `9`.
