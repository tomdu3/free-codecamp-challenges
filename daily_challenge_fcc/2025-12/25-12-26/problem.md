# Sum of Divisors

Given a positive integer, return the sum of all its divisors.

- A divisor is any integer that divides the number evenly (the remainder is `0`).
- Only count each divisor once.

For example, given `6`, return `12` because the divisors of `6` are `1`, `2`, `3`, and `6`, and the sum of those is `12`.
