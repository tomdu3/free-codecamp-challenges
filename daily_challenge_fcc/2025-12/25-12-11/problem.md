# Roman Numeral Builder

Given an integer, return its equivalent value in Roman numerals.

Roman numerals use these symbols:

|Symbol|Value|
|---|---|
I|1|
V|5|
X|10|
L|50|
C|100|
D|500|
M|1000|

Roman numerals are written from largest to smallest, left to right using the following rules:

-   Addition is used when a symbol is followed by one of equal or smaller value. For example, `18` is written as `XVIII` (10 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18).
-   Subtraction is used when a smaller symbol appears before a larger one, to represent 4 or 9 in any place value. For example, 19 is written as `XIX` (10 + (10 - 1)).
-   No symbol may be repeated more than three times in a row. Subtraction is used when you would otherwise need to write a symbol more than three times in a row. So the largest number you can write is 3999.

Here's one more example: given `1464`, return `"MCDLXIV"` (1000 + (500 - 100) + 50 + 10 + (5 - 1)).
