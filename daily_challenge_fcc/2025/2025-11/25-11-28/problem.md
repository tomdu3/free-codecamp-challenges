# Word Guesser

Given two strings of the same length, a secret word and a guess, compare the guess to the secret word using the following rules:

- The secret word and guess will only consist of uppercase letters (`"A"` to `"Z"`);
- For each letter in the guess, replace it with a number according to how it matches the secret word:
    - `"2"` if the letter is in the secret word and in the correct position.
    - `"1"` if the letter is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
    - `"0"` if the letter is not in the secret word.
- Each letter in the secret word can be used at most once.
- Exact matches (`"2"`) are assigned first, then partial matches (`"1"`) are assigned from left to right for remaining letters.
- If a letter occurs multiple times in the guess, it can only match as many times as it appears in the secret word.

For example, given a secret word of `"APPLE"` and a guess of `"POPPA"`, return `"10201"`:

The first `"P"` is not in the correct location (`"1"`), the `"O"` isn't in the secret word (`"0"`), the second `"P"` is in the correct location (`"2"`), the third `"P"` is a zero (`"0"`) because the two `"P"`'s in the secret word have been used, and the `"A"` is not in the correct location (`"1"`).
