# GCD

Given two positive integers, return their greatest common divisor (GCD).

-   The GCD of two integers is the largest number that divides evenly into both numbers without leaving a remainder.

For example, the divisors of `4` are `1`, `2`, and `4`. The divisors of `6` are `1`, `2`, `3`, and `6`. So given `4` and `6`, return `2`, the largest number that appears in both sets of divisors.
