# AI Detector

Today's challenge is inspired by the release of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022.

Given a string of one or more sentences, determine if it was likely generated by AI using the following rules:

- It contains two or more dashes (`-`).
    
- It contains two or more sets of parenthesis (`()`). Text can be within the parenthesis.
    
- It contains three or more words with 7 or more letters.
    
- Words are separated by a single space and only consist of letters (`A-Z`). Don't include punctuation or other non-letters as part of a word.
    

If the given sentence meets any of the rules above, return `"AI"`, otherwise, return `"Human"`.
