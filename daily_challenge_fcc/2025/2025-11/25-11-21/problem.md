# LCM

Given two integers, return the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers.

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers. For example, given `4` and `6`, return `12` because:

-   Multiples of `4` are `4`, `8`, `12` and so on.
-   Multplies of `6` are `6`, `12`, `18` and so on.
-   `12` is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.
