# Fingerprint Test

Given two strings representing fingerprints, determine if they are a match using the following rules:

-   Each fingerprint will consist only of lowercase letters (`a-z`).
-   Two fingerprints are considered a match if:
    -   They are the same length.
    -   The number of differing characters does not exceed 10% of the fingerprint length.
