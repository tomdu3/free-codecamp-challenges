# What's My Age Again?

Given the date of someone's birthday in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, return the person's age as of November 27th, 2025.

-   Assume all birthdays are valid dates before November 27th, 2025.
-   Return the age as an integer.
-   Be sure to account for whether the person has already had their birthday in 2025.
