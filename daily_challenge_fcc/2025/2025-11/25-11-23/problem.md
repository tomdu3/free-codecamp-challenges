Given a sentence string, return an array with a count of each character in alphabetical order.

- Treat upper and lowercase letters as the same letter when counting.
- Ignore numbers, spaces, punctuation, etc.
- Return the count and letter in the format `"letter count"`. For instance, `"a 3"`.
- All returned letters should be lowercase.
- Do not return a count of letters that are not in the given string.
