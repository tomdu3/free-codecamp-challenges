# Game of Life

Given a matrix (array of arrays) representing the current state in Conway's Game of Life, return the next state of the matrix using these rules:

- Each cell is either `1` (alive) or `0` (dead).
- A cell's neighbors are the up to eight surrounding cells (vertically, horizontally, and diagonally).
- Cells on the edges have fewer than eight neighbors.

Rules for updating each cell:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction).

For example, given:

```json
[
  [0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 0]
]
```

return:

```json
[
  [0, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 1]
]
```

Each cell updates according to the number of live neighbors. For instance, `[0][0]` stays dead (2 live neighbors), `[0][1]` stays alive (2 live neighbors), `[0][2]` dies (3 live neighbors), and so on.
