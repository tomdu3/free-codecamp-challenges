# Markdown Bold Parser

Given a string that may include some bold text in Markdown, return the equivalent HTML string.

- Bold text in Markdown is any text that starts and ends with two asterisks (`**`) or two underscores (`__`).
- There cannot be any spaces between the text and the asterisks or underscores, but there can be spaces in the text itself.
- Convert all bold occurrences to HTML `b` tags and return the string.

For example, given `"**This is bold**"`, return `"<b>This is bold</b>"`.

Note: The console may not display HTML tags in strings when logging messages. Check the browser console to see logs with tags included.
