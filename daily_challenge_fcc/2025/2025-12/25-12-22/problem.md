# Traveling Shopper

Given an amount of money you have, and an array of items you want to buy, determine how many of them you can afford.

- The given amount will be in the format `["Amount", "Currency Code"]`. For example: `["150.00", "USD"]` or `["6000", "JPY"]`.
- Each array item you want to purchase will be in the same format.

Use the following exchange rates to convert values:

| Currency | 1 Unit Equals |
| --- | --- |
| USD | 1.00 USD |
| EUR | 1.10 USD |
| GBP | 1.25 USD |
| JPY | 0.0070 USD |
| CAD | 0.75 USD |

- If you can afford all the items in the list, return `"Buy them all!"`.
- Otherwise, return `"Buy the first X items."`, where `X` is the number of items you can afford when purchased in the order given.
