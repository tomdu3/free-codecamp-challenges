# Snowflake Generator

Given a multi-line string that uses newline characters (`\n`) to represent a line break, return a new string where each line is mirrored horizontally and attached to the end of the original line.

- Mirror a line by reversing all of its characters, including spaces.

For example, given `"* \n *\n* "`, which logs to the console as:

```sh
* 
 *
* 
```

Return `"* *\n ** \n* *"`, which logs to the console as:

```sh
*  *
 ** 
*  *
```

Take careful note of the whitespaces in the given and returned strings. Be sure not to trim any of them.
