# Markdown Italic Parser

Given a string that may include some italic text in Markdown, return the equivalent HTML string.

- Italic text in Markdown is any text that starts and ends with a single asterisk (`*`) or a single underscore (`_`).
- There cannot be any spaces between the text and the asterisk or underscore, but there can be spaces in the text itself.
- Convert all italic occurrences to HTML `i` tags and return the string.

For example, given `"*This is italic*"`, return `"<i>This is italic</i>"`.

Note: The console may not display HTML tags in strings when logging messages. Check the browser console to see logs with tags included.
