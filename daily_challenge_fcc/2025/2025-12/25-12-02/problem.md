# Camel to Snake

Given a string in camel case, return the snake case version of the string using the following rules:

- The input string will contain only letters (`A-Z` and `a-z`) and will always start with a lowercase letter.
- Every uppercase letter in the camel case string starts a new word.
- Convert all letters to lowercase.
- Separate words with an underscore (`_`).
