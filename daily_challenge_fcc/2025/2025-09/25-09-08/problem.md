# Acronym Builder

Given a string containing one or more words, return an acronym of the words using the following constraints:

-   The acronym should consist of the first letter of each word capitalized, unless otherwise noted.
-   The acronym should ignore the first letter of these words unless they are the first word of the given string: `a`, `for`, `an`, `and`, `by`, and `of`.
-   The acronym letters should be returned in the order they are given.
-   The acronym should not contain any spaces.
