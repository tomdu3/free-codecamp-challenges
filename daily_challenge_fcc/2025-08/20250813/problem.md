# Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. When starting with `0` and `1`, the first 10 numbers in the sequence are `0`, `1`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, `8`, `13`, `21`, `34`.

Given an array containing the first two numbers of a Fibonacci sequence, and an integer representing the length of the sequence, return an array containing the sequence of the given length.

-   Your function should handle sequences of any length greater than or equal to zero.
-   If the length is zero, return an empty array.
-   Note that the starting numbers are part of the sequence.
