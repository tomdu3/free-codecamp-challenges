# File Storage

Given a file size, a unit for the file size, and hard drive capacity in gigabytes (GB), return the number of files the hard drive can store using the following constraints:

- The unit for the file size can be bytes (`"B"`), kilobytes (`"KB"`), or megabytes (`"MB"`).
- Return the number of whole files the drive can fit.
- Use the following conversions:

| Unit | Equivalent |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1 B | 1 B |
| 1 KB | 1000 B |
| 1 MB | 1000 KB |
| 1 GB | 1000 MB |

For example, given `500`, `"KB"`, and `1` as arguments, determine how many 500 KB files can fit on a 1 GB hard drive.
