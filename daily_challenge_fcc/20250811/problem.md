# Vowel Balance

Given a string, determine whether the number of vowels in the first half of the string is equal to the number of vowels in the second half.

- The string can contain any characters.
- The letters `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`, in either uppercase or lowercase, are considered vowels.
- If there's an odd number of characters in the string, ignore the center character.
