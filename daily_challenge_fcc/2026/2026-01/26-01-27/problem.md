# Odd or Even Day

Given a timestamp (number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch), return:

- `"odd"` if the day of the month for that timestamp is odd.
- `"even"` if the day of the month for that timestamp is even.

For example, given `1769472000000`, a timestamp for January 27th, 2026, return `"odd"` because the day number (`27`) is an odd number.
