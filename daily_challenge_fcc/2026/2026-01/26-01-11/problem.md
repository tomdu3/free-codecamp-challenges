# Par for the Hole

Given two integers, the par for a golf hole and the number of strokes a golfer took on that hole, return the golfer's score using golf terms.

Return:

-   `"Hole in one!"` if it took one stroke.
-   `"Eagle"` if it took two strokes less than par.
-   `"Birdie"` if it took one stroke less than par.
-   `"Par"` if it took the same number of strokes as par.
-   `"Bogey"` if it took one stroke more than par.
-   `"Double bogey"` if took two strokes more than par.
