# Resolution Streak

Given an array of arrays, where each sub-array represents a day of your resolution activities and contains three integers: the number of steps walked that day, the minutes of screen time that day, and the number of pages read that day; determine if you are keeping your resolutions.

- The first sub-array is day 1, and second day 2, and so on.

A day is considered successful if all three of the following goals are met:

- You walked at least 10,000 steps.
- You had no more than 120 minutes of screen time.
- You read at least five pages.

If all of the given days are successful, return `"Resolution on track: N day streak."` Where `N` is the number of successful days.

If one or more days is not a success, return `"Resolution failed on day X: N day streak."`. Where `X` is the day number of the first unsuccessful day, and `N` is the number of successful days before the first unsuccessful day.
