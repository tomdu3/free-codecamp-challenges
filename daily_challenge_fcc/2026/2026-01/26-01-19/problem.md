# Energy Consumption

Given the number of Calories burned during a workout, and the number of watt-hours used by your electronic devices during that workout, determine which one used more energy.

To compare them, convert both values to joules using the following conversions:

-   1 Calorie equals 4184 joules.
-   1 watt-hour equals 3600 joules.

Return:

-   `"Workout"` if the workout used more energy.
-   `"Devices"` if the device used more energy.
-   `"Equal"` if both used the same amount of energy.
