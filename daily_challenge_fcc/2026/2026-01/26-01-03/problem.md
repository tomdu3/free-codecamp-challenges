# Left-Handed Seat at the Table

Given a 4x2 matrix (array of arrays) representing the seating arrangement for a meal, determine how many seats a left-handed person can sit at.

-   A left-handed person cannot sit where a right-handed person would be in the seat to the immediate left of them.

In the given matrix:

-   An `"R"` is a seat occupied by a right-handed person.
-   An `"L"` is a seat occupied by a left-handed person.
-   An `"U"` is an unoccupied seat.
-   Only unoccupied seats are available to sit at.
-   The seats in the top row are facing "down", and the seats in the bottom row are facing "up" (like a table), so left and right are relative to the seat's orientation.
-   Corner seats only have one seat next to them.

For example, in the given matrix:

    [
      ["U", "R", "U", "L"],
      ["U", "R", "R", "R"]
    ]
    

The top-left seat is cannot be sat in because there's a right-handed person to the left. The other two open seats can be sat in because there isn't a right-handed person to the left.
