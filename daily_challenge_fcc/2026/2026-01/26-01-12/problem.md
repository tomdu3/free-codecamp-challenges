# Plant the Crop

Given an integer representing the size of your farm field, and `"acres"` or `"hectares"` representing the unit for the size of your farm field, and a type of crop, determine how many plants of that type you can fit in your field.

-   1 acre equals 4046.86 square meters.
-   1 hectare equals 10,000 square meters.

Here's a list of crops that will be given as input and how much space a single plant takes:

| Crop | Space per plant |
| --- | --- |
| `"corn"` | 1 square meter |
| `"wheat"` | 0.1 square meters |
| `"soybeans"` | 0.5 square meters |
| `"tomatoes"` | 0.25 square meters |
| `"lettuce"` | 0.2 square meters |

Return the number of plants that fit in the field, rounded down to the nearest whole plant.
