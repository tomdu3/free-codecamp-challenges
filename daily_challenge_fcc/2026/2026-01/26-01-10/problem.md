# Tic-Tac-Toe

Given a 3×3 matrix (an array of arrays) representing a completed Tic-Tac-Toe game, determine the winner.

-   Each element in the given matrix is either an `"X"` or `"O"`.

A player wins if they have three of their characters in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Return:

-   `"X wins"` if player X has three in a row.
-   `"O wins"` if player O has three in a row.
-   `"Draw"` if no player has three in a row.
