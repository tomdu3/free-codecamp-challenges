# Valid Pawn Moves

Given the position of one of your pawns on a chessboard, return an array of all the valid squares it can move to in ascending order.

A standard chessboard is 8x8, with columns labeled `A` through `H` (left to right) and rows labeled `1` through `8` (bottom to top). It looks like this:

| **A8** | **B8** | **C8** | **D8** | **E8** | **F8** | **G8** | **H8** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A7** | **B7** | **C7** | **D7** | **E7** | **F7** | **G7** | **H7** |
| **A6** | **B6** | **C6** | **D6** | **E6** | **F6** | **G6** | **H6** |
| **A5** | **B5** | **C5** | **D5** | **E5** | **F5** | **G5** | **H5** |
| **A4** | **B4** | **C4** | **D4** | **E4** | **F4** | **G4** | **H4** |
| **A3** | **B3** | **C3** | **D3** | **E3** | **F3** | **G3** | **H3** |
| **A2** | **B2** | **C2** | **D2** | **E2** | **F2** | **G2** | **H2** |
| **A1** | **B1** | **C1** | **D1** | **E1** | **F1** | **G1** | **H1** |

For this challenge:

-   You are the player on the bottom of the board.
-   Pawns can only move one square "up".
-   Unless the pawn is in the starting row (row 2), then it can move one or two squares up.

For example, given `"D4"`, return `["D5"]`, the only square your pawn can move to. Given `"B2"`, return `["B3", "B4"]`, because it's on the starting row and needs to be in ascending order.
