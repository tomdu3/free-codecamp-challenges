# 2026 Winter Games Day 11: Ice Hockey

Given an array of 6 ice hockey teams and their records after the round robin games, determine the match-ups for the semi-final round.

- Each array item will have a team and their record in the format `"TEAM: W-OTW-OTL-L"`. Where:
  - `"W"` is the number of wins in regulation, worth 3 points each
  - `"OTW"` is the number of overtime wins, worth 2 points each
  - `"OTL"` is the number of overtime losses, worth 1 point each
  - `"L"` is the number of losses, worth 0 points each

For example, `"FIN: 2-2-1-0"` would have 11 points after adding up their record.

Find the total number of points for each team and return `"The semi-final games will be (1st) vs (4th) and (2nd) vs (3rd)."`. For example, `"The semi-final games will be FIN vs SWE and CAN vs USA."`
