# 2026 Winter Games Day 10: Alpine Skiing

Given a ski hill's vertical drop, horizontal distance, and type, determine the difficulty rating of the hill.

To determine the rating:

- Calculate the steepness of the hill by taking the drop divided by the distance.
- Then, calculate the adjusted steepness based on the hill type:
  - `"Downhill"` multiply steepness by 1.2
  - `"Slalom"`: multiply steepness by 0.9
  - `"Giant Slalom"`: multiply steepness by 1.0

Return:

- `"Green"` if the adjusted steepness is less than or equal to 0.1
- `"Blue"` if the adjusted steepness is greater than 0.1 and less than or equal to 0.25
- `"Black"` if the adjusted steepness is greater than 0.25
