# Groundhog Day

Today is Groundhog Day, in which a groundhog predicts the weather based on whether or not it sees its shadow.

Given a value representing the groundhog's appearance, return the correct prediction:

- If the given value is the boolean `true` (the groundhog saw its shadow), return `"Looks like we'll have six more weeks of winter."`.
- If the value is the boolean `false` (the groundhog did not see its shadow), return `"It's going to be an early spring."`.
- If the value is anything else (the groundhog did not show up), return `"No prediction this year."`.
