# Digital Detox

Given an array of your login logs, determine whether you have met your digital detox goal.

Each log is a string in the format `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss"`.

You have met your digital detox goal if both of the following statements are true:

- You logged in no more than once within any four-hour period.
- You logged in no more than 2 times on any single day.
