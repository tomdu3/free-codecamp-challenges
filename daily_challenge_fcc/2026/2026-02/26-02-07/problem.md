# 2026 Winter Games Day 2: Snowboarding

Given a snowboarder's starting stance and a rotation in degrees, determine their landing stance.

- A snowboarder's stance is either `"Regular"` or `"Goofy"`.
- Trick rotations are multiples of 90 degrees. Positive indicates clockwise rotation, and negative indicate counter-clockwise rotation.
- The landing stance flips every 180 degrees of rotation.

For example, given `"Regular"` and `90`, return `"Regular"`. Given `"Regular"` and `180` degrees, return `"Goofy"`.
