# Credit Card Masker

Given a string of credit card numbers, return a masked version of it using the following constraints:

- The string will contain four sets of four digits (`0-9`), with all sets being separated by a single space, or a single hyphen (`-`).
- Replace all numbers, except the last four, with an asterisk (`*`).
- Leave the remaining characters unchanged.

For example, given `"4012-8888-8888-1881"` return `"****-****-****-1881"`.
