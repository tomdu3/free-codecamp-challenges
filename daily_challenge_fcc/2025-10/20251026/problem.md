# Duration Formatter

Given an integer number of seconds, return a string representing the same duration in the format `"H:MM:SS"`, where `"H"` is the number of hours, `"MM"` is the number of minutes, and `"SS"` is the number of seconds. Return the time using the following rules:

-   Seconds: Should always be two digits.
-   Minutes: Should omit leading zeros when they aren't needed. Use `"0"` if the duration is less than one minute.
-   Hours: Should be included only if they're greater than zero.
