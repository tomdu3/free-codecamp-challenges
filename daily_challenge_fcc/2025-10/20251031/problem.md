# SpOoKy~CaSe

Given a string representing a variable name, convert it to "spooky case" using the following constraints:

-   Replace all underscores (`_`), and hyphens (`-`) with a tilde (`~`).
-   Capitalize the first letter of the string, and every other letter after that, ignore the tilde character when counting.

For example, given `hello_world`, return `HeLlO~wOrLd`.
