# Complementary DNA

Given a string representing a DNA sequence, return its complementary strand using the following rules:

- DNA consists of the letters `"A"`, `"C"`, `"G"`, and `"T"`.
- The letters `"A"` and `"T"` complement each other.
- The letters `"C"` and `"G"` complement each other.

For example, given `"ACGT"`, return `"TGCA"`.
