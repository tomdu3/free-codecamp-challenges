# Space Week Day 3: Phone Home

For day three of Space Week, you are given an array of numbers representing distances (in kilometers) between yourself, satellites, and your home planet in a communication route. Determine how long it will take a message sent through the route to reach its destination planet using the following constraints:

- The first value in the array is the distance from your location to the first satellite.
- Each subsequent value, except for the last, is the distance to the next satellite.
- The last value in the array is the distance from the previous satellite to your home planet.
- The message travels at 300,000 km/s.
- Each satellite the message **passes through** adds a 0.5 second transmission delay.
- Return a number rounded to 4 decimal places, with trailing zeros removed.
