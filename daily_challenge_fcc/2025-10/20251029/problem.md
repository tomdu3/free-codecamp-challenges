# Email Sorter

On October 29, 1971, the first email ever was sent, introducing the `username@domain` format we still use. Now, there are billions of email addresses.

In this challenge, you are given a list of email addresses and need to sort them alphabetically by domain name first (the part after the `@`), and username second (the part before the `@`).

-   Sorting should be case-insensitive.
-   If more than one email has the same domain, sort them by their username.
-   Return an array of the sorted addresses.
-   Returned addresses should retain their original case.

For example, given `["jill@mail.com", "john@example.com", "jane@example.com"]`, return `["jane@example.com", "john@example.com", "jill@mail.com"]`.
