# Email Validator

Given a string, determine if it is a valid email address using the following constraints:

-   It must contain exactly one `@` symbol.
-   The local part (before the `@`):
    -   Can only contain letters (`a-z`, `A-Z`), digits (`0-9`), dots (`.`), underscores (`_`), or hyphens (`-`).
    -   Cannot start or end with a dot.
-   The domain part (after the `@`):
    -   Must contain at least one dot.
    -   Must end with a dot followed by at least two letters.
-   Neither the local or domain part can have two dots in a row.
