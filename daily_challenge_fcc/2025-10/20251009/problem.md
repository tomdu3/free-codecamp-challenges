# Space Week Day 6: Moon Phase

For day six of Space Week, you will be given a date in the format `"YYYY-MM-DD"` and need to determine the phase of the moon for that day using the following rules:

Use a simplified lunar cycle of 28 days, divided into four equal phases:

-   `"New"`: days 1 - 7
-   `"Waxing"`: days 8 - 14
-   `"Full"`: days 15 - 21
-   `"Waning"`: days 22 - 28

After day 28, the cycle repeats with day 1, a new moon.

-   Use `"2000-01-06"` as a reference new moon (day 1 of the cycle) to determine the phase of the given day.
-   You will not be given any dates before the reference date.
-   Return the correct phase as a string.
