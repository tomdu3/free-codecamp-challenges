# Speak Wisely, You Must

Given a sentence, return a version of it that sounds like advice from a wise teacher using the following rules:

- Words are separated by a single space.
- Find the first occurrence of one of the following words in the sentence: `"have"`, `"must"`, `"are"`, `"will"`, `"can"`.
- Move all words before and including that word to the end of the sentence and:
    - Preserve the order of the words when you move them.
    - Make them all lowercase.
    - And add a comma and space before them.
- Capitalize the first letter of the new first word of the sentence.
- All given sentences will end with a single punctuation mark. Keep the original punctuation of the sentence and move it to the end of the new sentence.
- Return the new sentence, make sure there's a single space between each word and no spaces at the beginning or end of the sentence.

For example, given `"You must speak wisely."` return `"Speak wisely, you must."`
