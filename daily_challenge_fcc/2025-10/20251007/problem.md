# Space Week Day 4: Landing Spot

In day four of Space Week, you are given a matrix of numbers (an array of arrays), representing potential landing spots for your rover. Find the safest landing spot based on the following rules:

- Each spot in the matrix will contain a number from `0-9`, inclusive.
- Any `0` represents a potential landing spot.
- Any number other than `0` is too dangerous to land. The higher the number, the more dangerous.
- The safest spot is defined as the `0` cell whose surrounding cells (up to 4 neighbors, ignore diagonals) have the lowest total danger.
- Ignore out-of-bounds neighbors (corners and edges just have fewer neighbors).
- Return the indices of the safest landing spot. There will always only be one safest spot.

For instance, given:

```js
[
  [1, 0],
  [2, 0]
]
```

Return `[0, 1]`, the indices for the `0` in the first array.
