# Digits vs Letters


Given a string, return `"digits"` if the string has more digits than letters, `"letters"` if it has more letters than digits, and `"tie"` if it has the same amount of digits and letters.

-   Digits consist of `0-9`.
-   Letters consist of `a-z` in upper or lower case.
-   Ignore any other characters.
