# Word Search

Given a matrix (an array of arrays) of single letters and a word to find, return the start and end indices of the word in the matrix.

-   The given matrix will be filled with all lowercase letters (`a-z`).
-   The word to find will always be in the matrix exactly once.
-   The word to find will always be in a straight line in one of these directions:
    -   left to right
    -   right to left
    -   top to bottom
    -   bottom to top

For example, given the matrix:

```md
[
  ["a", "c", "t"],
  ["t", "a", "t"],
  ["c", "t", "c"]
]
```

And the word `"cat"`, return:

```md
[[0, 1], [2, 1]]
```

Where `[0, 1]` are the indices for the `"c"` (start of the word), and `[2, 1]` are the indices for the `"t"` (end of the word).
