# Email Signature Generator

Given strings for a person's name, title, and company, return an email signature as a single string using the following rules:

-   The name should appear first, preceded by a prefix that depends on the first letter of the name. For names starting with (case-insensitive):
    -   `A-I`: Use `>>` as the prefix.
    -   `J-R`: Use `--` as the prefix.
    -   `S-Z`: Use `::` as the prefix.
-   A comma and space (`, ` ) should follow the name.
-   The title and company should follow the comma and space, separated by `" at "` (with spaces around it).

For example, given `"Quinn Waverly"`, `"Founder and CEO"`, and `"TechCo"` return `"--Quinn Waverly, Founder and CEO at TechCo"`.
