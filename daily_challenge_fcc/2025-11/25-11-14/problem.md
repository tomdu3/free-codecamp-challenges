# Is It the Weekend?

Given a date in the format `"YYYY-MM-DD"`, return the number of days left until the weekend.

-   The weekend starts on Saturday.
-   If the given date is Saturday or Sunday, return `"It's the weekend!"`.
-   Otherwise, return `"X days until the weekend."`, where `X` is the number of days until Saturday.
-   If `X` is `1`, use `"day"` (singular) instead of `"days"` (plural).
-   Make sure the calculation ignores your local timezone.
