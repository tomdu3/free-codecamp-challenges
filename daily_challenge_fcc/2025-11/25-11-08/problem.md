# Character Limit

In this challenge, you are given a string and need to determine if it fits in a social media post. Return the following strings based on the rules given:

- `"short post"` if it fits within a 40-character limit.
- `"long post"` if it's greater than 40 characters and fits within an 80-character limit.
- `"invalid post"` if it's too long to fit within either limit.
