# Ball Trajectory

Today's challenge is inspired by the video game Pong, which was released November 29, 1972.

Given a matrix (array of arrays) that includes the location of the ball (`2`), and the previous location of the ball (`1`), return the matrix indices for the next location of the ball.

- The ball always moves in a straight line.
- The movement direction is determined by how the ball moved from `1` to `2`.
- The edges of the matrix are considered walls. If the balls hits a:
    - top or bottom wall, it bounces by reversing its vertical direction.
    - left or right wall, it bounces by reversing its horizontal direction.
    - corner, it bounces by reversing both directions.
