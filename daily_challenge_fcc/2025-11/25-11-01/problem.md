# Signature Validation

Given a message string, a secret key string, and a signature number, determine if the signature is valid using this encoding method:

- Letters in the message and secret key have these values:
    - `a` to `z` have values `1` to `26` respectively.
    - `A` to `Z` have values `27` to `52` respectively.
- All other characters have no value.
- Compute the signature by taking the sum of the message plus the sum of the secret key.

For example, given the message `"foo"` and the secret key `"bar"`, the signature would be `57`:

```md
f (6) + o (15) + o (15) = 36
b (2) + a (1) + r (18) = 21
36 + 21 = 57
```

Check if the computed signature matches the provided signature.
